## Day 1 Assignment: Practice with Git and Github

Your only job today is to start to get used to using Git, Github, Github Desktop and Github Classroom since we'll be using them to manage the work for this program.

---

### Getting Started

1. You should have received an invitation from GitHub Classroom. Click the link and accept the invitation. This will create a private repository of the assignment for you.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer using GitHub Desktop.
3. It only has one file, this README. Open it in the text editor of your choice; RStudio will work. Make a change to this file (suggest below where it says MAKE YOUR FIRST CHANGE HERE) and save.
4. Go back to GitHub Desktop and you'll see the original text highlighted in red and your change highlighted in green. This is showing the the diff (difference) between the last commit and the current file.
5. Click **Commit to master**.
6. Click **Push origin**.
7. Go back to the GitHub repository in your browser and you should see your changes (you may have to refresh the page.)

Hello World!
